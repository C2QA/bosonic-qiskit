    "## What is a qumode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits are the world's simplest alphabet, allowing any piece of information to be represented using the characters 0 and 1. Qubits are an extension of the bit to quantum mechanics, allowing us to encode quantum information using arbitrary superpositions of the characters $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, formally known as *basis states*. But what if our alphabet is constructed from not just two characters (i.e., two basis states), but a countably infinite number? But what if instead of two characters, the alphabet were infinite?\n",
    "\n",
    "A bosonic mode, or \"qumode,\" is an object that can host any number of quanta. This endows the qumode with an infinite \"alphabet\" of basis states, each identified by the number of quanta corresponding to that state, i.e. $|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |2\\rangle, |3\\rangle,...$, all the way to infinity. These states are formally referred to as \"Fock\" states.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt desc](https://github.com/benmcdonough20/bosonic-qiskit-tutorials/raw/main/bosonic_qiskit_textbook/figures/energy_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows the two distinct states of a qubit (a) compared with the infinitely many distinguishable states of a qumode (b). The energies of the qumode states are evenly spaced because each photon contributes equally to the total energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dirac notation\n",
    "Dirac notation is a convenient way to represent quantum states, denoting a state by placing a label for the state within a \"ket\"--$|$ and $\\rangle$. Mutually exclusive, or \"distinguishable\" states, such as states with different energies or a different number of photons, are assigned to orthogonal vectors. This allows us to easily go back and forth between matrix notation and Dirac notation. For example, using the mutually exclusive states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1 \\rangle \\ \\dot{=} \\ \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The $\\dot =$ sign, meaning \"represented by,\" is used instead of equality to indicate that the choice of orthogonal vectors to assign to each state is arbitrary. We could easily have assigned $|0 \\rangle$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, resulting in a different representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac notation becomes particularly important for describing qumodes. With an infinite number of mutually exclusive states, the vectors would be infinitely long! The most general state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of a qumode can be written in the number basis as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n |n\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a_n$ are complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From qubits to qumodes\n",
    "Most of the familiar axioms for qubits generalize directly to qumodes. These are, briefly,\n",
    "1. **The Borne Rule:** If $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the state of the qumode and $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, then the probability of measuring $|\\psi\\rangle$ in the state $|n\\rangle$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\psi}(n) = |\\langle n | \\psi \\rangle|^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mutually exclusive states are orthogonal:** if $m\\neq n$, then $|n\\rangle$ and $|m\\rangle$ correspond to a mode with two different photon numbers, making these states mutually exclusive.  The Borne rule implies that the states are orthogonal, meaning that their *inner product* vanishes: $\\langle m | n \\rangle = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization:** The Borne rule also implies that all physical quantum states should be normalized. In the case of a discrete basis like the Fock basis, this implies that $\\langle n | m \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$. Kets such as $|x\\rangle$ comprising a continuous basis generally do not represent physical states, and they are delta-function normalized, meaning that $\\langle x' | x \\rangle = \\delta(x-x')$. Learn more about this in `operations.ipynb`."

    "## How do qubits and bosonic modes interact?\n",
    "At the heart of quantum computing with bosonic modes is the ability to make a qubit and a qumode interact. Just like both Clifford and non-Clifford gates are necessary for universal control of a qubit, both *Gaussian* and *non-Gaussian* gates are necessary to control a qumode. For qubits that are not truly two-level systems, an anharmonic potential is necessary to isolate the first two energy levels. Non-Gaussian gates on a qumode are only possible because of the anharmonicity introduced by the qubit. The following shows what is meant by \"anharmonicity.\" The figure below shows the cosine potential and first five energy levels of a transmon qubit vs the quadratic potential and first five energy levels of a qumode. The difference between the first two energy levels is chosen to be the same on both. The quadratic potential of the qumode leads to evenly spaced energy levels, whereas the levels of the transmon are not evenly spaced. This plot was produced using [scQubits](https://scqubits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
