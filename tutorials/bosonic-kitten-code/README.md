# Bosonic 'Kitten' Code Tutorial

This Jupyter notebook presents a tutorial for how one may implement the bosonic 'kitten' code using the Bosonic Qiskit package. 
As much as possible, this notebook explains the basics of bosonic error correction at the level of an undergraduate audience. The notebook is meant to be interactive, and users are 
encouraged to vary the parameters controlling the simulation as instructed within the notebook. There is also an accompanying IBM Qiskit blog article for this notebook, and 
it will be linked after its publication.

This work was produced in 2023 by Liu Zixiong as part of their PHYS 472 Independent Project in Physics course and subsequent summer research experience in Prof. Girvin's group 
at Yale University. This project was supervised by Prof. Steven M. Girvin, and Dr. Kevin Smith.
